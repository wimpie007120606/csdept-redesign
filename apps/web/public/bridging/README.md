# Bridging Course – Computer Science

A 3-day mini bridge course for absolute beginners. Materials are provided in **Java**, **Python**, and **C**.

## Folder structure

- **Day1/** – Absolute basics (hello world, variables, basic input)
- **Day2/** – Control flow (if/else, loops) and functions
- **Day3/** – Arrays/lists and a small mini-project
- **Exercises/** – Exercise sheets for each day

## How to use

1. **Option A:** Work through the files in order (Day 1 → Day 2 → Day 3) in your chosen language (Java, Python, or C).
2. **Option B:** Download this entire ZIP and unzip it. Open the files in a text editor or IDE, then compile/run as described below.

## Compile and run

### Java
- Compile: `javac MyFile.java`
- Run: `java MyFile` (use the class name without .java)
- Make sure you are in the folder that contains the .java file.

### Python
- Run: `python hello_world.py` (or `python3 hello_world.py` on some systems)
- No separate compile step.

### C
- Compile: `gcc -o myprogram hello_world.c`
- Run: `./myprogram` (on Windows you may get `myprogram.exe`)

## Suggested path

1. Day 1 – Run the hello world program, then try the variables/input examples.
2. Day 2 – Try control flow and functions.
3. Day 3 – Work with arrays and the mini-project.
4. Do the exercises in the **Exercises** folder after each day.

Good luck!
