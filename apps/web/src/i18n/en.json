The most significant such course series was a four-day programming bootcamp presented 2012–2015 for CapaCITI (an IT initiative of the City of Cape Town).\n\nDuring 1997 – 1998 a kernel was developed to support protocol stacks on low-powered embedded computing platforms. This kernel was taken over by the South African company SAN People and refined further to support various protocol stacks on embedded devices.\n\nIn 1994 the Gneiss microkernel was developed as an improved version of the Hybrid kernel. The Gneiss kernel was used by Spescom-DataVoice to develop a digital voice recording system. This product is marketed locally and internationally and various device drivers were developed for Gneiss to support new device controllers as required.\n\nThe Hybrid microkernel was developed during 1990 – 1991. This kernel was designed to support client-server based applications in a distributed environment. The Hybrid kernel was used for developing a distributed application to monitor manufacturing processes in a number of local factories.\n\nIn 1988 the Institute was commisioned by the South African company Technology Systems Manufacturing to port Tanenbaum's MINIX system (a Unix-like operating system) to a Data General minicomputer. The goal was to develop local expertise in system programming.\n\nDuring 1988 – 1993 software was developed for Telkom SA to configure, monitor, optimise and analyse some of their networks.\n\nSNAP, a package to model and analyse stochastic queueing networks, was developed during 1978 – 1985. It was used mainly to predict the performance of IBM mainframe computer systems. The package was sold to UCCEL Corporation in 1985."

Capacity is limited and admission is very competitive, so the minimum requirements listed below does not guarantee admission:",

    "s1HonoursBullets": "need a degree that covers our Computer Science curriculum\nmust have obtained an average of at least 65% for your Computer Science modules in your final year. The yearbook lists the minimum average required to apply as 60%, but due to the number of applications we receive for the BSc Honours in CS programme, you typically require at least 65%.\nmust have a strong mathematical foundation, covering both Algebra and Calculus\nmust have at least 32 credits at second-year or third-year level in quantitative modules, which include any module under the following subjects: Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Mathematical Statistics, Bioinformatics, and Operations Research and the modules: GIT242 Digital Photogrammetry and GIT341 Spatial Modeling (note their prerequisites)\nmust have practical programming experience; our Honours degree has a strong focus on programming and it is imperative that you can program to successfully complete the Honours degree",
    "s1Note": "Note, that meeting the minimum requirements means that you will be considered for selection, but does not guarantee admission.",
    "s1IndividualPara": "To register for any individual postgraduate module you need either a degree in Computer Science or must have already fulfilled all the requirements to obtain one and to receive it at the next scheduled graduation ceremony. Furthermore, the same mathematics, programming, and Computer Science background as needed for an Honours in Computer Science is required.",
    "s1Masters": "The entry requirements for a Masters in Computer Science is a degree in Computer Science and an Honours degree",
    "s1Doctoral": "The entry requirements for a Doctoral in Computer Science is a thesis-based Masters degree and a degree that covers the required Computer Science background.",

    "s2Step1": "This step is only for prospective Masters and Doctoral students. You need the agreement of a staff member that will supervise your Masters/Doctoral thesis. Browse through our Research pages and read more about the kind of work we do. You can also look at our staff's publications to get an idea of the kind of topics they are interested in. If you have found an area of our research that interests you, contact the responsible staff member to discuss potential topics.

The links are available under the Application to SU menu.\nthe Science Faculty website; under the What can I study? drop-down menu, click on Postgraduate Programmes.

    "s3Title": "What about part-time/foreign students?",
    "s3PartTimePara": "The university allows students to enter as part-time students. The degree then extends over more years; the honours degree can be extended to a maximum of two years, which must be consecutive. A part-time Masters degree extends over three to four years. Generally speaking, this is a much harder alternative and requires self-discipline and dedication.",
    "s3HonoursNoteTitle": "Honours students should take note of the following:",
    "s3HonoursNoteBullets": "The project has to be completed within either the first or the second year\nYou have to complete 6 semester-modules in total, but you can choose which ones to complete in which year\nAll of our modules are presented during working hours, and there is no option at the moment to attend lectures after-hours. If you have a full-time job, you will have to arrange with your employer to attend lectures.",
    "s3ForeignPara": "We also welcome applications from foreign students. In addition to the application steps mentioned above, you should also contact the university's Postgraduate Office for administrative details about studying at Stellenbosch. Stellenbosch University has many partnership agreements with foreign universities, making it easy to arrange student exchanges. Our 16 credit modules are equivalent to 8 ECTS credits, and all of the modules are presented in English.",
    "s4Title": "What about the costs and financial support?",
    "s4Para1": "Computer Science does not offer any direct support for students, but the university as a whole does, and of course there are many external bursaries available. The university's portal for prospective students is a good source of information about such bursaries and up-to-date details about tuition fees. (International students should also have a look at the \"Student fees and funding » Funding\" section of the Postgraduate Office website.)",
    "s4Para2": "Most of our undergraduate modules require teaching assistants and we expect students who have completed them to get involved with at least one such module. While it will not provide enough income to support your studies, these positions can provide some supplemental income. But more than this: becoming a teaching assistant is not only a wonderful way to help the next generation of Computer Science students with their studies, but also a great opportunity to consolidate your own knowledge!",
    "s4Para3": "Some supervisors also have research funds available to support Masters or Doctoral students, but once again it may not necessarily provide enough income to cover all your expenses. Note that you cannot rely on this and must talk directly to the supervisor about this option.",
